# Privacy Policy for OneDay Memory

**Effective Date:** December 04, 2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **OneDay Memory** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your data and respects your privacy rights.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
OneDay Memory is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, store, or share your personal data on our servers.**

### 2.1 Photo Library Access
- **Purpose:** Our app requires access to your Photo Library to display photos, organize them into "Memories" and "Galleries," and allow you to add notes to them.
- **Processing:** All photo processing and organization happen locally on your device.
- **Storage:** We do not upload your photos to any external server owned by us.

### 2.2 Location Data
- **Purpose:** We may request access to your location data to display the location where a photo was taken and to fetch historical weather data for your memories.
- **Storage:** Location metadata is stored locally within the app's database on your device.

### 2.3 User-Generated Content
- Any text, notes, or "memories" you create within the app are stored locally on your device.

## 3. Data Storage and Sync (iCloud)
- **iCloud Sync:** OneDay Memory uses Apple's **CloudKit** (iCloud) to synchronize your data (memories, gallery organization, and notes) across your own Apple devices.
- **Security:** Your data is stored in your private iCloud container. **We (the developers) do not have access to your iCloud data.**
- **Control:** You can manage or delete your iCloud data at any time through your device's Apple ID settings.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We do not use third-party analytics SDKs or advertising networks that track your behavior.

- **Weather Data:** The app may use Apple's WeatherKit or similar system services to retrieve weather information. This data is processed according to Apple's privacy standards.

## 5. Data Retention
Since we do not store your data on our servers, you retain full control over your data retention. Deleting the app or removing data from within the app will remove it from your local device. If you have enabled iCloud backup, data may remain in your iCloud account until you delete it.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect data, we do not track age.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
