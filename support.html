        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Why can't I see photos from previous years?</h3>
        <p>OneDay Memory relies on the date metadata inside your photos. Please ensure you have granted the app "Full
            Access" to your Photo Library so it can scan your dates. Also, make sure your photos have correct date
            information.</p>

        <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We do not have access to your photos or notes. Everything is stored on your device and synced via your
            personal iCloud account.</p>

        <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
        <p>You can delete individual memories or galleries within the app. To delete all data, simply delete the app. If
            you want to clear iCloud data, go to your iPhone Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Account Storage >
            OneDay Memory > Delete Data.</p>

        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can view and create memories offline. Changes will sync to iCloud automatically once you are back
            online.</p>
